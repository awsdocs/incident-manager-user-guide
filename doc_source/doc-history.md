| [Incident Manager integration with ServiceNow](#doc-history) | You can integrate Incident Manager with [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) by using the AWS Service Management Connector for ServiceNow\. After you configure integration, new incidents created in Incident Manager create a corresponding incident in ServiceNow\. If you update an incident in Incident Manager, the updates are added to the corresponding incident in ServiceNow\. If you resolve an incident in either Incident Manager or ServiceNow, the corresponding incident is also resolved, based on configured preferences\.

| [Import contact details](#doc-history) | When an incident is created, Incident Manager can notify responders by using voice or SMS notifications\.
