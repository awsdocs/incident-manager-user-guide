| Change | Description | Date |

| [Use Microsoft Teams as a chat channel in response plans](#doc-history) | Through integration with Microsoft Teams and AWS Chatbot, you can now use Microsoft Teams for the chat channel in your response plans\. This is an addition to support for Slack and Amazon Chime chat channels\. During an incident, Incident Manager sends status notifications directly to a chat channel to keep all responders informed\. Responders can also communicate with one another and incident\-related AWS CLI commands in the Microsoft Teams application to update and interact with the incidents\. For more information, see [Working with chat channels in Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/chat.html)\. | April 4, 2023 | 
| [New feature: On\-call schedules](#doc-history) | An on\-call schedule in Incident Manager defines who is notified when an incident occurs that requires operator intervention\. An on\-call schedule consists of one or more rotations you create for the schedule\. Each rotation can include up to 30 contacts\. After you create an on\-call schedule, you can include it as an escalation in your escalation plan\. When an incident associated with that escalation plan occurs, Incident Manager notifies the operator \(or operators\) who are on call according to the schedule\.
