# Setting up for AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager<a name="setting-up"></a>

We recommend setting up AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager in the account that you use to manage your operations\. Before you use Incident Manager for the first time, complete the following tasks:

**Topics**
+ [Get an AWS account and your root user credentials](#getting-started-signup)
+ [Creating an IAM user](#getting-started-create-iam-user)
+ [Signing in as an IAM user](#getting-started-signin-iam-user)
+ [Creating IAM user access keys](#getting-started-iam-user-access-keys)
+ [Required role for Incident Manager set up](#iam-prereq-service-role)

## Get an AWS account and your root user credentials<a name="getting-started-signup"></a>

To access AWS, you must sign up for an AWS account\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root)\.

 AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign\-up process is complete\. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by going to [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My Account**\.

## Creating an IAM user<a name="getting-started-create-iam-user"></a>

If your account already includes an IAM user with full AWS administrative permissions, you can skip this section\.

When you first create an AWS account, you begin with one sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\.

**Important**  
We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks\. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform\. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

To create an administrator user, choose one of the following options\.


****  

| Choose one way to manage your administrator | To | By | You can also | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In IAM Identity Center \(Recommended\) | Use short\-term credentials to access AWS\.This aligns with the security best practices\. For information about best practices, see [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#bp-users-federation-idp) in the *IAM User Guide*\. | Following the instructions in [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide\. | Configure programmatic access by [Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\. | 
| In IAM \(Not recommended\) | Use long\-term credentials to access AWS\. | Following the instructions in [Creating your first IAM admin user and user group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) in the IAM User Guide\. | Configure programmatic access by [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the IAM User Guide\. | 

## Signing in as an IAM user<a name="getting-started-signin-iam-user"></a>

 Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) by choosing **IAM user** and entering your AWS account ID or account alias\. On the next page, enter your IAM user name and your password\.

**Note**  
For your convenience, the AWS sign\-in page uses a browser cookie to remember your IAM user name and account information\. If you previously signed in as a different user, choose the sign\-in link beneath the button to return to the main sign\-in page\. From there, you can enter your AWS account ID or account alias to be redirected to the IAM user sign\-in page for your account\.

## Creating IAM user access keys<a name="getting-started-iam-user-access-keys"></a>

Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS\. If you don't have access keys, you can create them from the AWS Management Console\. As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user access keys for any task where it's not required\. Instead, [create a new administrator IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) with access keys for yourself\.

The only time that you can view or download the secret access key is when you create the keys\. You cannot recover them later\. However, you can create new access keys at any time\. You must also have permissions to perform the required IAM actions\. For more information, see [Permissions required to access IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_permissions-required.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**To create access keys for an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose access keys you want to create, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

1. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**\.

1. To view the new access key pair, choose **Show**\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\. Your credentials will look something like this:
   + Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   + Secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

1. To download the key pair, choose **Download \.csv file**\. Store the keys in a secure location\. You will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes\.

   Keep the keys confidential in order to protect your AWS account and never email them\. Do not share them outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon\.com\. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key\.

1. After you download the `.csv` file, choose **Close**\. When you create an access key, the key pair is active by default, and you can use the pair right away\.

## Required role for Incident Manager set up<a name="iam-prereq-service-role"></a>

Before you begin, your account must have the IAM permission `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`\. Incident Manager uses this permission to create the `AWSServiceRoleforIncidentManager` in your account\. To learn more about this service linked role, see [Using service\-linked roles for Incident Manager](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.
