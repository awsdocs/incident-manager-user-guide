# Resource\-based policy examples for AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager<a name="security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples"></a>

AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager supports resource\-based permissions policies for Incident Manager response plans and contacts\.

Incident Manager doesn't support resource\-based policies that deny access to resources shared using AWS RAM\.

To learn how to create a response plan or contact, see [Response plans](response-plans.md) and [Contacts](contacts.md)\.

## Restricting Incident Manager response plan access by organization<a name="security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-restrict-response-plan-by-org"></a>

The following example grants permissions to users in the organization with the organization ID: `o-abc123def45` to respond to incidents created using the response plan `myplan`\.

The `Condition` block uses the `StringEquals` conditions and the `aws:PrincipalOrgID` condition key, which is an AWS Organizations specific condition key\. For more information about these condition keys, see [Specifying conditions in a policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html)\.
