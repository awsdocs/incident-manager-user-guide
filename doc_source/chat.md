# Chat channels<a name="chat"></a>

A key feature of AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager is the ability to directly communicate through chat channels during an incident\. During an incident, Incident Manager pushes incident updates and notifications directly to the chat channel to keep all responders informed\. Responders can update and interact with the incident directly from the chat channel by using chat commands\. For more information about AWS Chatbot, see [AWS Chatbot Administrator Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/chatbot-slack-lambda-integration.html)\.

## Set up an AWS Chatbot client<a name="chat-create"></a>

Using SNS topics with Incident Manager incurs the costs of SNS\. For more information, see [Amazon SNS pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/pricing/)\.

## Configuring SNS permissions<a name="chat-sns"></a>

Before you can use the AWS Chatbot client during an incident, update the access policy of the related Amazon SNS topics\. 

1. Navigate to the Amazon SNS [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/) and choose **Topics** from the navigation panel\. 

1. Select the Amazon SNS topic related to the AWS Chatbot client you set up in the previous section\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Expand the **Access policy** section and add the following statement to the policy's **Statement** array\.

   ```
        {
         "Sid": "IncidentManagerSNSPublishingPermissions",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": "ssm-incidents.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action": "SNS:Publish",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:example_SNS_topic",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEqualsIfExists": {
             "AWS:SourceAccount": "111122223333"
            }
          }
        }
   ```
**Important**  
The AWS service ssm\-incidents\.amazonaws\.com must have permissions to publish to the chat channel's SNS topic\. Without permissions to publish to the SNS topic, Incident Manager will not be able to publish notifications to your chat channel\.

1. Replace the `Resource` value *"arn:aws:sns:us\-east\-1:111122223333:example\_SNS\_topic"* with your Amazon SNS topic ARN\.

1. Replace the `AWS:SourceAccount` value *"111122223333"* with your AWS account ID\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

Use the previous steps to update each SNS topic related to the configure AWS Chatbot client\.

## Interacting through chat<a name="chat-interact"></a>

Incident Manager enables responders to interact with incidents directly from the chat channel\. Chat commands are only available in Slack chat channel\. These are some common commands:
+ [CreateTimelineEvent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTimelineEvent.html)
+ [DeleteTimelineEvent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTimelineEvent.html)
+ [GetIncidentRecord](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetIncidentRecord.html)
+ [GetTimelineEvent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteTimelineEvent.html)
+ [ListIncidentRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListIncidentRecords.html)
+ [ListTimelineEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListTimelineEvents.html)
+ [UpdateIncidentRecord](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateIncidentRecord.html)
+ [UpdateTimelineEvent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTimelineEvent.html)

To use any of the preceding commands from an active incident's chat channel, use the following format\. Replace *<CLI Command>* with any of the preceding commands and its appropriate fields\. 

```
@aws ssm-incidents <CLI Command>
```

```
@aws ssm-contacts <CLI Command>
```

## Best practices<a name="chat-best-practices"></a>

Best practices to keep in mind when configuring your chat channels using AWS Chatbot\. 
+ AWS Chatbot enabled Slack channels inherit the permissions of the IAM role used to configure AWS Chatbot\. This enables responders in an AWS Chatbot enabled Slack channel to call any allow\-listed action; such as Incident Manager APIs and retrieving metrics graphs\.
+ Maintain principal of least permission, practice security standards, and regularly review membership of your AWS Chatbot enabled chat channels\.
